Hey all!

We are: 
Henrique Llorente: hlorente
Nikolas Mihailidis: mnikolas
Pranav Aurora: pranava
Rafael Marques: rmarques

This is Group 17's version of PennBooks. This was created using node and express for the backend, dynamodb for the database, and react for the front end.

This will be run on an EC2 instance. 

We are quite proud of some of our extra-credit features we have implemented including:
- notifications for friends request, chat invites
- users can post pictures, and also set their own profile pictures 
- seemless transitions on the frontend between routes

We have also managed to implement the required features including facebook style newsfeed, chat, and article recommendation on the newsfeed. 

All the code that is written by us.

To run the application
- backend, cd into api, and run node api.
- frontend, cd into nets212, and run npm start for the React front end. 
(please also run npm install to download all the required packages we have used)
